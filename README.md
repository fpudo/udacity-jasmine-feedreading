To run this project open the index.html on your browser.

## Tests

When you load the index.html, you will see that all tests have passed. However, try modifying the index.html or the app.js located inside the js folder to see the tests failing:

1) On app.js, if you comment or delete the objects inside
the variable allFeeds, you will see a test failure.

2) On index.html, if you change the name of the class on the body tag element, there will be another failure.

3) If you change the class on the anchor tag, you will see failure,
because it shouldn't toggle the hidden menu anymore.
